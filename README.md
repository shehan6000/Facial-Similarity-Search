# Facial-Similarity-Search
## Overview
In this project, we'll create a facial similarity search system using DeepFace for facial recognition and Pinecone for indexing and search. We'll work with a dataset of family photos, encode the images using DeepFace, and use Pinecone to search for similar faces.
